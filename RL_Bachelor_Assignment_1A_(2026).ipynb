        "\n",
        "Reinforcement learning agents learn by performing actions. If we assume that these agents start with zero knowledge, they would need to start by performing random actions to gather knowledge about their outcomes. However, we cannot keep acting randomly indefintely, as it would be very inefficient. Ideally, once we know that certain actions are bad, we no longer want to waste time in trying them again and instead want to focus on more promising actions. However, if an action leads to a bad results, can we be certain that it is a bad action? Perhaps we have just been unlucky; or earlier/follow-up actions had been the cause of the bad outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hopefully you start to see the problem: we need to somehow balance **exploring** the unknown for long enough to be reasonably certain the observed outcomes are indeed the *true* outcome. Simultaniously, we do not want to waste too much time exploring bad actions, and instead should **exploit** the knowledge we have gained. This problem is known as the **exploration-vs-exploitation tradeoff** and is an ever-present issue in most learning tasks.\n",
        "\n",

        "Let's briefly recap an intuitive view on RL: An **Agent** observes some **environment state** $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and, based on this observation, decides on an **action** $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$. With this action and current state, the environment provides a next state and a **reward**. This loop continues until our environment terminates in some final state.\n",

        "We can simplify by removing the time dimension from our problem, such that we have a \"one-step\" RL setting. That is, the environment terminates immediately after our first action and we only receive a (single) reward.\n",

        "\n",
        "We can simplify one step further by removing the context (observation/state). Perhaps unsurprisingly, this setting is known as a **bandit**. A bandit is equivalent to a contextual bandit where the agent always observes the same -- the observation contains no useful information to act on and the agent is acting \"blind\".\n",

We can only approximate this average by sampling rewards from the same action multiple times. As such, we again face the **exploration-vs-exploitation tradeoff**. We want to explore each action sufficiently to get a good estimate of its *real* reward so that we find the actual best action. However, we need to balance this such that we waste as little actions as possible on bad (costly) actions.\n",

Perhaps the user would not have clicked any recommendation and the bot was just unlucky. As you may see, we require methods to deal with this tradeoff.\n",

Conversely, bandit agents should store an estimate of the rewards for each action in some array. This estimate is called the Q-value and we initialize it to some arbitrary value (`self.Q = np.zeros(n_actions)`).\n",
        "The training loop (`train()`) is then typically quite simple. As you can see in the function, we simply sample an action, observe the resulting reward, and update the agents knowledge (`self.Q`) with this new knowledge. This we simply repeat a number of times.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first agent below, the `NaiveAgent` always exploits the current knowledge it has by simply selecting the action for which it estimates the highest reward (`action = np.argmax(self.Q)`). Always selecting the best-estimated action is known as the **greedy** policy. When the `NaiveAgent` observes a reward for any action, it stores the observed reward in its knowledge array (`self.Q`).\n",
        "The second agent, the `RandomAgent` simply selects a random action each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "You might expect both agents to perform pretty poorly, and you'd be right. However, please inspect and run the below code, as the structure of other agents will be similar. Furthermore, make sure you understand the `experiment()` function. Note that we repeat the experiment a large (500) amount of times. This is because, by pure chance, any agent may perform very well (or poor) on any randomly initialized environment. Scientifically, this is not desirable, so we repeat the experiment with varying seeds and average the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- The idea in any type of Bandit (or RL) agent is to select an action by sampling from its internal action distribution, known as the **policy (π)**. Afterwards, the agent updates its knowledge about the resulting \"goodness\" of the performed action by storing it somehow. Naturally, all bandit agents store an estimate of the rewards for each action in some array. This estimate is called the Q-value and we initialize it to some arbitrary value (`self.Q = np.zeros(n_actions)`). Often, the Q-values are used to construct its policy -- the agent acts based on the knowledge it has acquired. -->\n",

The idea here is that we want to select the best action (like the `NaiveAgent`) with some probability, while exploring a random action (like the `RandomAgent`) by some other probability. This probability is what we refer to as the epsilon ϵ value. Mathematically, we can formulate the select action function like below:\n",
